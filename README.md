# Whatilearned

Chrome extension to track what you learn each day. Inspired by Momentum.

## Features:
- Angular 2
- Ability to add entries by day (grouped if multiple)
- Local storage
- Google search for entries based on their context (working to improve)
- Yahoo Weather API for giving dashboard info

##  Future Ideas:
- Hooking up with a backend for authentication and ability to store entries in a DB
- Having reminders about what you learned the same day last month (for example)
- Possibly machine learning for analyzing user entries and patterns that exist

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
